# CI2024_lab2
I have used swap mutuation and cycle crossover algorithms. 
I tried random value for having minimum cost and to use either mutuation or crossover algorithms in each loop.
For each country I tried 2 different possibilities to reach the minimum cost. I have used set-cover_ea.ipynb folder as reference.
